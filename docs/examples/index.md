Learn Tova through practical, annotated examples that progressively introduce language features.

## Getting Started

- **[Hello World](./hello-world.md)** -- Your first Tova program. Covers `print`, string interpolation, functions, and running with `tova run`.

- **[Counter App](./counter.md)** -- A client-side reactive counter. Introduces `state`, `computed`, `match` expressions, and JSX components.

## Full-Stack Applications

- **[Todo App](./todo-app.md)** -- A complete full-stack CRUD application. Covers shared types, server routes, RPC, client reactivity, effects, and component composition.

- **[Chat App](./chat.md)** -- Real-time messaging with Server-Sent Events. Demonstrates SSE endpoints, streaming data to clients, and reactive message lists.

## Advanced Patterns

- **[Multi-Server Architecture](./multi-server.md)** -- Named server blocks for separating API, WebSocket, and other concerns into independent processes.

- **[Authentication Flow](./auth-flow.md)** -- JWT-based authentication with registration, login, and protected endpoints. Covers password hashing, middleware, and token management.

- **[Database & Models](./database.md)** -- Database configuration, model definitions, CRUD routes, and query patterns using Tova's built-in ORM.
